My name is Jelena Mirkovic and I am Research Associate Professor at University of Southern California and a PI of the [DISCERN project](../README.md). For this project, I and my research team are running a user study on [SPHERE research infrastructure](https://sphere-testbed.net) to collect data on legitimate use of research infrastructures. The study has been reviewed and approved as exempt by the USC's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Here is more information about the study.
